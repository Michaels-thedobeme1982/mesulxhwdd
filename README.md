OMG, just got done watching Snow White and I'm like, what the heck was that? It's like, bro, why are dwarfs so shiny and annoyingly cheerful? Seriously. It's like they had way too much sugar or something. It's kinda exhausting, TBH. 

And Snow White herself! Man, she's old-school Disney, all singing and stuff, but no one in real life is that chipper all the time. Like, calm down, girl, take a nap or something. And don't even get me started on the Evil Queen. Like, she's the most extra villain ever. That magic mirror tho... Can I get one of those?? ðŸ˜‚

> I mean, I just wanted to download the movie for a chill evening, you know? But ended up with a musical fairy tale extravaganza! How did we survive our childhood watching this stuff? The forest scene was trippy as hell. Those eyes everywhere... Hashtag creeped out. 

And the Prince? Does he even have a personality? Just seems to exist to smooch girls in a coma. Come on, Disney, give us some character depth here! Like, good looks are cool and all but gimme a break. Anyway, I suppose itâ€™s classic, right? Classic basically means just let it be weird. 

It's like, I wanted to watch the movie with an open mind but ended up being all what is happening? Nostalgia is such a weird thing, like does the film even hold up? Well, sorta... in that trippy vintage kind of way. 

string somethingRandom = oops, wrong window;

But yeah, prob won't rewatch soon, lol. I need a strong coffee now. Or like a modern movie where people actually behave like regular humans. ðŸ˜‚
